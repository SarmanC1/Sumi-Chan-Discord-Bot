# **Sumi-Chan-Discord-Bot**

This bot is for the discord server Social Hub owned by Sarman#4515 and used mainly for people who play on the Hypixel Server on the popular hit game known as Minecraft.
I will work to continously post updates on this repository. I hope to expand it so it can be used by any server and hopefully become a hit.

Powerful bot that will soon be able to complete many tasks, essentially an all purpose bot hosted on the Heroku Cloud Platform. {Discord.py}

```Requirements:
Python -3 -m pip install -U discord.py

py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
```
## **Current Features:**

- Checking bot's latency when hosted
- Logging those who join the server in an embed in Mod Log's channel (Currently only my server)
- Log's who creates invites to the server and also sends invites to people
- Deletes any "discord.gg/" links in chat to stop any server advertisement in all channels if prohibited
- Join Voice Channels (VC's) when requested

## **Work In Progress Features(WIP)**

- Leaving Voice Channels
- Playing Music
- Setting auto role to "Member" role
