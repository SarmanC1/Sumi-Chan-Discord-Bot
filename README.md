# **Sumi-Chan-Discord-Bot** üòÄ

This bot has been created for the discord server Social Hub owned by Sarman#4515, for people who play on the Hypixel Server on the popular game Minecraft.
I will work to continously post updates on this repository. I hope to expand it so it can be used by any server and hopefully become a hit.

It will be a powerful bot that will be able to complete many tasks, essentially an all-purpose bot hosted on GitHub Pages. {Discord.py}


## Required installs

## **Current Features:**
