# **Sumi-Chan Discord Bot** üòÄ

This bot has been created for the discord server Social Hub owned by Ramen Shop#4515, for people who play on the Hypixel Server on the popular game Minecraft.
I will work to continously post updates on this repository. I hope to expand it so it can be used by any server and hopefully become a hit.

It will be a powerful bot that will be able to complete many tasks, essentially an all-purpose bot hosted on GitHub Pages. {Discord.py}


## **Current Features:**

- Checking bot's latency when hosted
- Logging those who join the server in an embed in Mod Log's channel (Currently only my server)
- Log's who creates invites to the server and also sends invites to people
- Deletes any "discord.gg/" links in chat to stop any server advertisement in all channels if prohibited
- General moderation (bans, mutes)

## **Work In Progress Features(WIP)**

- Setting up new music features removing old one
- Setting auto role to "Member" role
- Warns
- Economy Game with a Database
- Hypixel API!!!

## **Requirements set for the bot**

- Music
- Moderation
- Bot responding to messages
- Hypixel API
- Timers
- Tests like Trivia
- Reaction Roles
- Voice Control
- Calculator
- Math Helper
- Economy
- Anime Releases
